        "A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.\n",
        "ðŸ”¹ Why are Data Structures Important?\n",
        "â€¢\tThey help in efficient storage and retrieval of data.\n",
        "â€¢\tThey make our programs faster and easier to understand.\n",
        "â€¢\tThey are used in real-life applications like databases, operating systems, games, and more.\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ Examples in Real Life:\n",
        "â€¢\tA list of names stored in a mobile contact app (can be stored in an array or linked list).\n",
        "â€¢\tA stack of plates (LIFO â€“ Last In First Out).\n",
        "â€¢\tA queue at a ticket counter (FIFO â€“ First In First Out).\n",

        "Lesson 2: Primitive & Non-Primitive Data Structures, Operations\n",
        "ðŸ”¹ Primitive Data Structures:\n",
        "These are the basic building blocks provided by most programming languages.\n",
        "â€¢\tInteger (int)\n",
        "â€¢\tFloat (float)\n",
        "â€¢\tCharacter (char)\n",
        "â€¢\tBoolean (true/false)\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ Example in C:\n",
        "int age = 25;\n",
        "float height = 5.9;\n",
        "char grade = 'A';\n",
        "ðŸ”¹ Non-Primitive Data Structures:\n",

        "ðŸ”¹ Arrays:\n",
        "An array is a collection of similar data items stored in a continuous memory location.\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ Example in C:\n",
        "int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};\n",
        "â€¢\tnumbers[0] is 10, numbers[1] is 20, and so on.\n",
        "â€¢\tUseful when you want to store multiple values of the same type.\n",
        "ðŸ”¹ Structures:\n",
        "A structure (struct) is used to store a group of items of different types under one name.\n",

        "A union is similar to a structure but uses the same memory location for all its members. Only one member can hold a value at a time.\n",

        "struct Node {\n",
        "    int data;\n",
        "    struct Node* next;\n",
